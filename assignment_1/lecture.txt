the book for the class usually call the controls that go within the user interface called "controls". Remember that the UI
is just simply a rectangle of pixels.


let's say we have a class called Banking : Form
{
  private const int height = 800;

  //constants are declared here such as:
    Button computer = new Button()
    Button quit = new Button()

  //constructor made here
      within the constructor we have this line
            Controls.add(quitbutton);
            compute.Click += new EventHandler(Manage);  //this says that when this object gets mouse clicked, it called Manage function
      this shows the quit button at the bottom of the UI.
}

public Bank(){
bluepen=new Pen(Color.Blue, 3);
}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~How do you change the UI?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  this will repaint the entire picture -as said by the professor:

protected override voidd OnPaint(PaintEventArgs image ){
  Graphics whiteboard = image.Graphics; //image is a reserved word
  whiteboard.DrawLine(bluepen, 0,650,1200,650 )   //we're telling it to use a certain pen:(bluepen, how far from the right and how far down, how far to extend and how much to extend the shape down)
  whiteboard.FillRectangle(brush, 0,650,1200,150);

  base.OnPaint(image);    //it takes the image you've written on and makes it permanent on the UI. it calls OnPaint in the parent class that is located in Form and returns it
}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

protected void Manage(){
  Invalidate();   //if this is called, then it called protected override void OnPaint function....
}


within the constructor we create the the function pen
private Pen bluepen = new Pen (Color.Blue, 3)   //the bluepen is 3pixels wide
//now we cna use it in the draw functions now

priate Brushes brush = new Brushes(Color.Yellow);












//NOTE
  class name uppercase
  function name
  object is usually lowercase









  at the bottom off the window should be the buttons red green and blue followed by the sizes (take a picture).
  take a class and inheirt it from Form
  the user should be able to chnage their mind about which size and color to use, so we should be able to store the last
    option choosen, (should not be drawn until the user clicks draw)
