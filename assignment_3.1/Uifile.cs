//Program name: Ninety Degree Turn
//Programming language: C Sharp
//Date development of program began: 2018-Oct-18
//Date of last update: 2018-Oct-18

//Purpose:  This programs demonstrate how an animated ball can turn in a 90 degree angle and still maintain constant speed.

//Files in project: ninety-degree-main.cs, straight-line-travel-user-interface.cs, straight-line-travel-algorithms.cs, r.sh

//This file's name: ninety-degree-ui.cs
//This file purpose: This module (file) defines the layout of the user interface
//Date last modified: 2018-Oct-19

//Known issues: None that the author is aware

//To compile straight-line-travel-user-interface.cs:
//     mcs -target:library -r:System.Drawing.dll -r:System.Windows.Forms.dll -r:straight-functions.dll -out:straight-line.dll straight-line-travel-user-interface.cs
//
//Hardcopy of source files: For printing 132 horizontal columns are needed to avoid line wrap in portrait orientation.

//Suggestion: As user of this program feel free to experiment especially by changing the values of delta (distance traveled
//between tics) and animation_clock_speed.  Make these changes in the source code itself.  Try to find the best combination
//of numbers that makes a smooth moving ball (no jerkiness).

//Convention: The short name 'x' denotes the x-coordinate of the upper left corner of the ball.
//            The short name 'y' denotes the y-coordinate of the upper left corner of the ball.
//            This program does not reference the ball by the coordinates of the center of the ball.

//An old fashioned technique used with double and float numbers is used in this program.
//Sometimes we don't require that two doubles be perfectly equal to each other -- sometimes just being close is good enough.
//Suppose a and b are two doubles.  In this program a and b are considered equal if the absolute value of (a-b) is very very close to zero.
//In this program you will see: System.Math.Abs(y+radius-p0y)<0.5.  That means y+radius is almost equal to p0y.
//Now you know what such statements mean.
